# launchriot-web
A React Boilerplate using Redux, Thunk, Axios, React Router, Hooks and more.
_______________________________

LaunchRiot Web was built and designed to work with a Laravel API, but can really consume anything RESTful.

It uses create-react-app as it's foundation.

To get started, clone the repo and run `npm install`.

After installation completes, run `npm run start`.

Change constants to work with your own API in `api/constants`.

Features include:
- Public Routes
- Private Routes
- Guest Routes
- Multiple Route Layouts

Packages include:
- react-thunk
- react-redux
- react-router
- semantic-ui
- and more.

This project, including this ReadMe, is a work in progress.
